SSH
In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server provided by ALX-Holberton School.

Tasks 📋
0️⃣ Use a private key - Bash script that uses ssh to connect to the school provided server.

1️⃣ Create an SSH key pair - Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

2️⃣ Client configuration file - SSH configuration file configured to use the private key `~/.ssh/holberton and to refuse authenication using a password.

4️⃣ Client configuration file - Making changes to SSH configuration file using Puppet. The ssh_config file is configured to use private key and refuse password authentication.
